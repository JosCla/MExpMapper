# MExpMapper
MExpMapper is a map development tool for [MExp](https://github.com/JosCla/MExp).

## Building the Project
Send all .8xp files from the **src** folder to your calculator, then open the [Axe Parser Compiler](https://www.ticalc.org/archives/files/fileinfo/456/45659.html), and compile MEXP to an Application.

- **doc**: General documentation for the game. The top-level text files are commented versions of the game's source code files.
- **src**: The actual source files for the game, for editing on the calculator.
