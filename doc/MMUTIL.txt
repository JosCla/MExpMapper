Lbl CPRV {
    .Just the Copy() command but copies bytes in reverse order
    .(Good for copying a portion of memory to an overlapping portion
    .  that's forwards in memory)
    .r1: Base memory address (source)
    .r2: Base memory address (target)
    .r3: Number of bytes to copy
    .(returns nothing)

    For(G,1,r_3)
        {r_1+r_3-G}->{r_2+r_3-G}
    End
}

Lbl DGWP {
    .DispGraph with parity
    .(Will call DispGraph while also tracking its parity)

    DispGraph^r
    1-CP->CP

    Return
}

Lbl DGUP {
    .DispGraph until a certain parity is met
    .r1: Desired parity

    If CP!=r_1
        DGWP()
    End
